## JavaScript ThreeBody simulation generator

This is a fun project that renders a random gravitational three-body simulation with JavaScript in Html5. It's a simple program that uses an explicit implementation to simulate the system over a specified timescale. In addition to stopping after a specified amount of time, the simulation will quit if there is a collision between bodies or one or more bodies is ejected from the system. It then makes a pretty animation (with randomly generated fake background stars) and saves it locally.

Modify the values in the code to adjust the displacement data.
