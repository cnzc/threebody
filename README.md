## ThreeBody Problem

The three body problem is the basic mechanical model in Celestial mechanics.

It refers to the problem of the motion laws of three celestial bodies with arbitrary masses, initial positions, and initial velocities that can be regarded as particles under the influence of mutual gravitational attraction.

It is now known that the three body problem cannot be accurately solved, that is, it cannot predict the mathematical scenarios of all three body problems, and only a few special cases have been studied.

The simplest example of a three body problem is the motion of the Sun, Earth, and Moon in the solar system. In the vast universe, the size of planets can be ignored, so we can consider them as particles. If the influence of other planets in the solar system is not taken into account, their motion is only generated under the action of gravity, so we can consider their motion as a three-body problem.

## JavaScript ThreeBody simulation generator

This is a fun project that renders a random gravitational three-body simulation with JavaScript in Html5. It's a simple program that uses an explicit implementation to simulate the system over a specified timescale. In addition to stopping after a specified amount of time, the simulation will quit if there is a collision between bodies or one or more bodies is ejected from the system. It then makes a pretty animation (with randomly generated fake background stars) and saves it locally.

Modify the values in the code to adjust the displacement data.
